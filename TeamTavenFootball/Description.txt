*********************Classes*********************
GameObject : Its abstract class Everything in the game is GameObject
	1 There is property called Name
	2 There is property Position which is new structure Vector2D
	3 There is Active when true the game object is active when false it is not
	It should implement all the interfaces it inherits

Player : It is class that creates players on the game
	Player is inherit of GameObject
	Player has property Speed
	Player has Color property
	Player has Vector2 Size property
	Player has constructor taking parameters vector2 position, int speed, color
		It should implement all the interfaces it inherits	

InputController : Its static class that checks for inputs
		It has 4 properties
		If Up Arrow is pressed then Player1Up property will be true
		If Down Arrow is pressed then Player1Down property will be true
		If W is pressed then Player Player2Up property will be true
		If S is pressed then Player Player2Down property will be true
		There is 2 static void methods
		First is OnKeyDown which has arguments (object sender, KeyEventArgs e) that checks if key is pressed
		Second is OnKeyUp which has arguments (object sender, KeyEventArgs e) that checks if key stop being pressed
			It should implement all the interfaces it inherits

	It should implement all the interfaces it inherits


*********************Structures*********************
Vector2D
	Vector 2D have 3 properties X and Y and PointZero 
				X is int
				Y is int
				PointZero is static Vector2D with coordinates x: 0, y: 0
				Implement operators for +, -, *, /, == and !=


*********************Interfaces*********************
IGameObject : It requires implementation of all properties in the GameObject
IMovable : It gives a method called Move(Vector2D positionToGoTo) will move GameObject vector to the vector in the method
IShape : it requires property Shape
IName it requires property Name
IColor it requires property Color

*********************Enumarations*********************
Color: It has colors like Red, Blue, etc
Shape: It has circle, rectangle etc
