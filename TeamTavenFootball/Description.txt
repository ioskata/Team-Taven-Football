Classes:
GameObject : Its abstract class Everything in the game is GameObject
	1 There is property called Name
	2 There is property Position which is new structure Vector2D
	3 There is Active when true the game object is active when false it is not


Structures:
Vector2D
	Vector 2D have 3 properties X and Y and PointZero 
				X is float 
				Y is float
				PointZero is static Vector2D with coordinates x: 0, y: 0
				Implement operators for +, -, *, /, == and !=


Interfaces:
IGameObject : It requires implementation of all properties in the GameObject
IMovable : It gives a method called Move(Vector2D positionToGoTo) will move GameObject vector to the vector in the method

Enumarations:
